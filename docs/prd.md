# MessageAI Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Deliver a production-quality cross-platform messaging app with WhatsApp-level reliability and real-time sync capabilities
- Implement AI-enhanced messaging features that make conversations more productive, accessible, and meaningful
- Prove messaging infrastructure solidity through real-time delivery, offline support, and optimistic UI updates
- Enable one-on-one and group chat functionality with complete message persistence and delivery tracking
- Deploy a working MVP within 24 hours demonstrating all core messaging capabilities

### Background Context

MessageAI builds upon the proven success of WhatsApp's messaging infrastructure while adding modern AI capabilities. WhatsApp demonstrated that just two developers could create a messaging platform serving 2 billion users by focusing on reliability, speed, and cross-platform compatibility. Today's AI coding tools make it possible to build production-quality messaging apps even faster while going beyond traditional messaging with intelligent features.

The core challenge combines two distinct technical domains: first, building robust messaging infrastructure with message persistence, real-time delivery, optimistic UI updates, efficient data sync, and offline support; second, layering AI capabilities using LLMs, agents, and RAG pipelines to enhance the messaging experience with features like conversation summarization, real-time translation, and intelligent response assistance. The MVP focuses on proving the messaging infrastructure is solid, with a simple chat app that reliably delivers messages being more valuable than a feature-rich app with unreliable sync.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The app should deliver a clean, familiar messaging experience prioritizing speed and reliability over visual complexity. Users expect instant message delivery with clear visual feedback for all interaction states. The interface should feel responsive even on poor connections through optimistic UI updates and clear status indicators. Navigation should be minimal and intuitive - users access their conversation list and dive directly into chats without unnecessary steps.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Conversation-centric navigation:** Primary view is a list of conversations (one-on-one and groups) sorted by most recent activity
- **Optimistic sending:** Messages appear immediately in the chat when sent, with subtle visual indicators showing delivery progression
- **Pull-to-refresh patterns:** Users can manually refresh conversation lists and sync messages when needed
- **Inline media handling:** Images display inline within conversations without requiring separate viewers for basic viewing
- **Real-time presence feedback:** Online/offline status and typing indicators appear inline within chat headers

### Core Screens and Views

- **Authentication Screen** - Login/signup with email and profile setup (display name, profile picture)
- **Conversation List** - Main screen showing all chats with recent message previews and timestamps
- **Chat View (One-on-One)** - Message thread with input field, send button, and image attachment option
- **Chat View (Group)** - Group message thread with member attribution for each message
- **Profile/Settings** - Basic user profile management and app settings

### Accessibility

**WCAG AA** - Target WCAG AA compliance for core functionality including sufficient color contrast, touch target sizes, and screen reader support for critical user flows

### Branding

Minimal custom branding for MVP. Focus on clean, modern messaging UI aesthetic similar to WhatsApp/Signal with neutral color palette. Primary brand elements limited to app icon and name. Post-MVP can introduce custom theming and brand personality.

### Target Device and Platforms

**Mobile Only (iOS)** - MVP targets iOS devices exclusively via React Native with Expo. The app should be optimized for iPhone screen sizes from iPhone SE to Pro Max. Responsive considerations for tablet displays are deferred to post-MVP. Web and Android platforms are post-MVP considerations.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

**Monorepo** - A single repository containing both the React Native mobile app and Firebase Cloud Functions backend code. This simplifies version management, enables atomic commits across frontend/backend changes, and streamlines the development workflow for a small team or solo developer working on MVP.

### Service Architecture

**Serverless Monolith within Monorepo** - The backend uses Firebase services (Firestore, Cloud Functions, Auth, FCM) providing serverless infrastructure without managing servers. The mobile app is a monolithic React Native application. This architecture prioritizes rapid MVP development and leverages Firebase's built-in real-time sync, authentication, and push notification capabilities. Cloud Functions will be structured for future AI feature integration (post-MVP).

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing** - Implement unit tests for critical business logic (message queueing, offline sync, optimistic updates) and integration tests for Firebase interactions (Firestore queries, Auth flows, message delivery). Focus testing on the core reliability requirements from the Project Brief testing scenarios:
- Message persistence across app restarts
- Offline message queueing and sending
- Optimistic UI state management
- Real-time sync with Firestore
- Group chat message attribution

Manual testing remains critical for UI/UX validation and end-to-end messaging flows across multiple devices.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **React Native with Expo (Managed Workflow):** Use Expo's managed workflow to maximize development speed and simplify iOS deployment/testing. Expo provides out-of-the-box support for push notifications, image handling, and device testing.

- **Firebase SDK Integration:** Use Firebase JavaScript SDK v9+ (modular SDK) for optimized bundle size and tree-shaking support.

- **Local State Management:** Implement local message persistence using AsyncStorage or a lightweight SQLite solution (expo-sqlite) to support offline access and message history.

- **Real-time Listeners:** Use Firestore real-time listeners (onSnapshot) for live message updates, presence indicators, and typing status.

- **Optimistic UI Pattern:** Implement a message queueing system with local-first writes that immediately update UI, then sync to Firestore with retry logic for failed sends.

- **Image Storage:** Use Firebase Storage for image uploads with client-side compression before upload to optimize bandwidth.

- **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript for type safety across React Native components and Firebase Cloud Functions to reduce runtime errors and improve developer experience.

- **Development Environment:** Assumes developer has Node.js, npm/yarn, Expo CLI, and Xcode (for iOS simulator) installed and configured.

- **State Management:** Use React Context API with useReducer for global state management (current user, conversations, message queue, online/offline status). This avoids third-party state management libraries for MVP while providing sufficient structure for the application's state needs.

- **UI Component Library:** Use React Native Paper (Material Design components) to accelerate UI development with consistent, accessible, and well-tested components that work seamlessly with Expo.

- **Analytics:** Deferred to post-MVP. Focus on core messaging functionality and reliability rather than usage analytics.

10. Background/killed app notifications deferred to post-MVP (only foreground required for MVP gate)
11. Testing: User A sends message to User B while B has app open but viewing different conversation - B sees notification

### Story 2.8: Network Error Handling & Retry Logic

As a user,
I want the app to gracefully handle network errors and retry operations,
so that temporary connectivity issues don't break my messaging experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. All Firestore operations wrapped in try-catch with user-friendly error messages

7. Image timestamps and sender attribution shown same as text messages
8. Cached images persist locally for offline viewing (using AsyncStorage or device cache)
9. Failed image loads show placeholder with retry option
10. Images work in both one-on-one and group chats

### Story 3.6: Firebase Storage Security Rules & Optimization

As a developer,
I want proper Firebase Storage security and performance optimization,
so that image sharing is secure and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Firebase Storage security rules allow authenticated users to upload images to their own paths
2. Security rules prevent users from deleting or overwriting others' images
3. Image file size validation: Maximum 10MB per image
4. File type validation: Only allow JPEG, PNG, WebP formats
5. Storage quota monitoring configured in Firebase Console
6. Image URLs use Firebase Storage signed URLs with appropriate expiration
7. Cleanup strategy for orphaned images documented (manual cleanup acceptable for MVP)
8. Storage rules tested: Unauthorized users cannot access or modify images
9. Image upload error handling includes quota exceeded and permission denied scenarios

### Story 3.7: MVP Completion Testing

As a developer,
I want to validate all MVP hard-gate requirements are met,
so that the project passes the 24-hour checkpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **One-on-one chat:** ✅ Users can send/receive text messages in real-time
2. **Real-time delivery:** ✅ Messages appear instantly between 2+ users
3. **Message persistence:** ✅ Chat history survives app restarts
4. **Optimistic UI:** ✅ Messages appear instantly before server confirmation
5. **Online/offline status:** ✅ Presence indicators working

7. **User authentication:** ✅ Users have accounts with profiles
8. **Basic group chat:** ✅ 3+ users can chat in group conversations
9. **Message read receipts:** ✅ Read status tracking implemented
10. **Push notifications:** ✅ Foreground notifications working
11. **Deployment:** ✅ App running on iOS simulator with Firebase backend deployed
12. **All Epic 2 reliability tests:** ✅ All 7 testing scenarios pass
13. **Image sharing:** ✅ Users can send/receive images in both chat types
14. Final demo recorded showing all features working end-to-end

## Checklist Results Report

### Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 92% ✅
**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right ✅
**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready ✅
**Most Critical Concern:** Minor - Data schema implicit in stories, explicit data model diagram would enhance architect handoff

### Category Analysis

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None - Problem, goals, and context clearly defined       |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | None - Scope boundaries clear, AI deferred appropriately |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS    | None - UI goals, flows, and screens well-documented      |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | None - All 14 FRs testable and user-focused              |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS    | None - Performance, reliability, and tech stack defined  |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | None - 3 epics, 25 stories, sequenced logically          |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None - Architecture, testing, and tech stack specified   |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Minor - Data schema implicit in stories, not explicit    |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None - Clear language, structured, ready for handoff     |

### Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- All MVP hard-gate requirements from Project Brief fully covered in epics/stories
- Epic and story structure is production-ready with logical sequencing enabling incremental delivery
- Functional requirements are exemplary - 14 FRs, all testable and user-focused
- Technical guidance provides clear constraints: Firebase stack, TypeScript, React Native + Expo
- Story acceptance criteria are comprehensive (avg 8-10 items each)
- MVP scope shows excellent YAGNI discipline: AI deferred, iOS only, image-only media

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- Data model could be explicitly documented with Firestore schema diagram (currently implicit in stories)
- User flow diagrams would enhance UX section
- CI/CD not addressed (acceptable for MVP manual deployment)

### Recommendations for Architect

1. Design Firestore security rules for collections: /users, /conversations, /messages
2. Document message/conversation data schema with indexing strategy for real-time queries
3. Design React Context architecture (AuthContext, MessagesContext, NetworkContext)
4. Specify Cloud Function structure for push notifications (Story 2.7)

### Final Decision

✅ **READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. Minor data model documentation would enhance handoff but schema is clear from acceptance criteria.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Review this PRD and create detailed UI/UX specifications including:
- User flow diagrams for core journeys (onboarding, messaging, group creation)
- Wireframes for critical screens (Conversation List, Chat View, Group Info)
- Design system basics (color palette, typography, component library guidance)
- Accessibility implementation guide for WCAG AA compliance

Focus on the MVP scope - one-on-one and group messaging with images. Ensure designs work within React Native Paper component constraints.

### Architect Prompt

Review this PRD and create the architecture document covering:

**Data Model:**
- Firestore collections schema (/users, /conversations, /messages)
- Document field specifications and data types
- Indexing strategy for real-time queries
- Firestore security rules for all collections

**Application Architecture:**
- React Native app structure and navigation flow
- React Context architecture (AuthContext, MessagesContext, NetworkContext)
- State management patterns for optimistic UI and offline queue
- Firebase SDK integration patterns

**Backend Architecture:**
- Cloud Functions structure for push notifications
- Firebase Storage organization and security rules
- Authentication flow implementation
- Real-time listener patterns for messages, presence, typing indicators

**Technical Specifications:**
- Message queueing and retry logic implementation approach
- Offline persistence strategy (AsyncStorage vs SQLite)
- Image upload/compression pipeline
- Error handling and network resilience patterns

Ensure all architectural decisions align with Technical Assumptions section and support the 25 user stories across 3 epics.
