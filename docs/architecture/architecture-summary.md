# Architecture Summary

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Firebase Backend-as-a-Service:** Eliminates custom API server, provides real-time sync, auth, and storage out-of-box
2. **React Native + Expo:** Cross-platform mobile development with rapid iteration via managed workflow
3. **Monorepo with Shared Types:** TypeScript interfaces shared between mobile and Cloud Functions ensure type safety
4. **Offline-First Pattern:** AsyncStorage + optimistic UI + message queue = WhatsApp-level reliability
5. **Direct Firebase Integration:** Mobile app communicates directly with Firestore/Auth/Storage via SDK
6. **Minimal Cloud Functions:** Only used for push notifications, keeping backend simple
7. **Context API State Management:** Sufficient for MVP scope, avoids Redux overhead

## Architecture Validation Against PRD Requirements

| Requirement | Architecture Support |
|-------------|---------------------|
| FR1: Authentication | Firebase Auth + User collection |
| FR2-FR3: One-on-one chat | Conversation + Message collections with real-time listeners |
| FR4: Image sharing | Firebase Storage + MediaManager component |
| FR5: Group chat | Conversation.type discriminator + participants array |
| FR6-FR7: Delivery states & read receipts | Message.status enum + readBy array |
| FR8: Presence indicators | Presence collection with onDisconnect handlers |
| FR9: Typing indicators | TypingStatus subcollection with TTL |
| FR10: Message persistence | AsyncStorage local cache |
| FR11: Push notifications | Cloud Function + FCM |
| FR12: Offline queue | OfflineQueueService + AsyncStorage |
| FR13: Optimistic UI | MessagingEngine immediate UI updates |
| FR14: Crash-proof messaging | Queue persists across restarts |

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Epic 1: Foundation** (Stories 1.1-1.9)
   - Set up monorepo structure
   - Configure Firebase project
   - Initialize React Native app with Expo
   - Implement authentication flows
   - Build basic one-on-one messaging

2. **Epic 2: Reliability** (Stories 2.1-2.9)
   - Implement AsyncStorage persistence
   - Build optimistic UI pattern
   - Create offline message queue
   - Add delivery states and read receipts
   - Implement push notifications
   - Validate all 7 reliability testing scenarios

3. **Epic 3: Groups & Media** (Stories 3.1-3.7)
   - Add group creation and management
   - Implement image upload/download
   - Finalize Firebase security rules
   - Complete MVP testing checklist

## Critical Implementation Notes

- **Security Rules Must Be Deployed First:** Without proper Firestore/Storage rules, app will fail in production mode
- **Firestore Indexes Required:** Composite index for user conversations query must be created before querying
- **FCM Configuration:** iOS requires APNs certificates configured in Firebase Console for push notifications
- **Expo EAS Build:** If native push notifications needed, may require ejecting from managed workflow or using EAS Build
- **Testing with Multiple Devices:** Real-time sync and offline scenarios require testing on multiple physical devices or simulators
