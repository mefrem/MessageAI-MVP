# Introduction

This document outlines the complete architecture for **MessageAI**, a production-quality mobile messaging application with real-time sync, offline support, and WhatsApp-level reliability. The architecture covers the React Native mobile application, Firebase serverless backend, and their integration patterns.

This unified architecture combines mobile frontend concerns (React Native, state management, offline persistence) with serverless backend design (Firebase services, Cloud Functions, real-time sync), ensuring consistency across the technology stack for AI-driven development.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield Project**

This is a new React Native + Firebase messaging application built from scratch. No starter templates are being used, though we'll leverage standard React Native with Expo managed workflow for rapid development.
