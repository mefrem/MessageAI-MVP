# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The app should deliver a clean, familiar messaging experience prioritizing speed and reliability over visual complexity. Users expect instant message delivery with clear visual feedback for all interaction states. The interface should feel responsive even on poor connections through optimistic UI updates and clear status indicators. Navigation should be minimal and intuitive - users access their conversation list and dive directly into chats without unnecessary steps.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Conversation-centric navigation:** Primary view is a list of conversations (one-on-one and groups) sorted by most recent activity
- **Optimistic sending:** Messages appear immediately in the chat when sent, with subtle visual indicators showing delivery progression
- **Pull-to-refresh patterns:** Users can manually refresh conversation lists and sync messages when needed
- **Inline media handling:** Images display inline within conversations without requiring separate viewers for basic viewing
- **Real-time presence feedback:** Online/offline status and typing indicators appear inline within chat headers

## Core Screens and Views

- **Authentication Screen** - Login/signup with email and profile setup (display name, profile picture)
- **Conversation List** - Main screen showing all chats with recent message previews and timestamps
- **Chat View (One-on-One)** - Message thread with input field, send button, and image attachment option
- **Chat View (Group)** - Group message thread with member attribution for each message
- **Profile/Settings** - Basic user profile management and app settings

## Accessibility

**WCAG AA** - Target WCAG AA compliance for core functionality including sufficient color contrast, touch target sizes, and screen reader support for critical user flows

## Branding

Minimal custom branding for MVP. Focus on clean, modern messaging UI aesthetic similar to WhatsApp/Signal with neutral color palette. Primary brand elements limited to app icon and name. Post-MVP can introduce custom theming and brand personality.

## Target Device and Platforms

**Mobile Only (iOS)** - MVP targets iOS devices exclusively via React Native with Expo. The app should be optimized for iPhone screen sizes from iPhone SE to Pro Max. Responsive considerations for tablet displays are deferred to post-MVP. Web and Android platforms are post-MVP considerations.
