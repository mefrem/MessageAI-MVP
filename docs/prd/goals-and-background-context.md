# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver a production-quality cross-platform messaging app with WhatsApp-level reliability and real-time sync capabilities
- Implement AI-enhanced messaging features that make conversations more productive, accessible, and meaningful
- Prove messaging infrastructure solidity through real-time delivery, offline support, and optimistic UI updates
- Enable one-on-one and group chat functionality with complete message persistence and delivery tracking
- Deploy a working MVP within 24 hours demonstrating all core messaging capabilities

## Background Context

MessageAI builds upon the proven success of WhatsApp's messaging infrastructure while adding modern AI capabilities. WhatsApp demonstrated that just two developers could create a messaging platform serving 2 billion users by focusing on reliability, speed, and cross-platform compatibility. Today's AI coding tools make it possible to build production-quality messaging apps even faster while going beyond traditional messaging with intelligent features.

The core challenge combines two distinct technical domains: first, building robust messaging infrastructure with message persistence, real-time delivery, optimistic UI updates, efficient data sync, and offline support; second, layering AI capabilities using LLMs, agents, and RAG pipelines to enhance the messaging experience with features like conversation summarization, real-time translation, and intelligent response assistance. The MVP focuses on proving the messaging infrastructure is solid, with a simple chat app that reliably delivers messages being more valuable than a feature-rich app with unreliable sync.
