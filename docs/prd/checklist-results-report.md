# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 92% ✅
**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right ✅
**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready ✅
**Most Critical Concern:** Minor - Data schema implicit in stories, explicit data model diagram would enhance architect handoff

## Category Analysis

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None - Problem, goals, and context clearly defined       |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | None - Scope boundaries clear, AI deferred appropriately |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS    | None - UI goals, flows, and screens well-documented      |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | None - All 14 FRs testable and user-focused              |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS    | None - Performance, reliability, and tech stack defined  |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | None - 3 epics, 25 stories, sequenced logically          |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None - Architecture, testing, and tech stack specified   |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Minor - Data schema implicit in stories, not explicit    |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None - Clear language, structured, ready for handoff     |

## Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- All MVP hard-gate requirements from Project Brief fully covered in epics/stories
- Epic and story structure is production-ready with logical sequencing enabling incremental delivery
- Functional requirements are exemplary - 14 FRs, all testable and user-focused
- Technical guidance provides clear constraints: Firebase stack, TypeScript, React Native + Expo
- Story acceptance criteria are comprehensive (avg 8-10 items each)
- MVP scope shows excellent YAGNI discipline: AI deferred, iOS only, image-only media

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- Data model could be explicitly documented with Firestore schema diagram (currently implicit in stories)
- User flow diagrams would enhance UX section
- CI/CD not addressed (acceptable for MVP manual deployment)

## Recommendations for Architect

1. Design Firestore security rules for collections: /users, /conversations, /messages
2. Document message/conversation data schema with indexing strategy for real-time queries
3. Design React Context architecture (AuthContext, MessagesContext, NetworkContext)
4. Specify Cloud Function structure for push notifications (Story 2.7)

## Final Decision

✅ **READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. Minor data model documentation would enhance handoff but schema is clear from acceptance criteria.
